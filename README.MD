# Simple JWT API

This is a simple API that uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for bearer token authentication. It is written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data storage.

The project can be forked and used as a bootstrap for API development as all required authentication endpoints and logic have already been implemented.

If you appreciate the project, remember to leave a star! Thank you.
